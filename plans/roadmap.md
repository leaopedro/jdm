# JDM Experience — Technical Roadmap

> Companion to `brainstorm.md`. Tracks every implementation task, grouped by
> phase. Each task is scoped for a single agent to pick up.
>
> **Do not change the contents of this file except to update the status
> markers on task lines.** No re-scoping, no re-ordering, no rewriting
> descriptions. If scope drifts, capture the delta in `handoff.md` or the
> feature's implementation plan, not here.

## How to use this document

- **Tasks are ordered.** Within a phase, the order respects dependencies.
  Don't start a task until everything it depends on is checked.
- **Each task has a minimal spec:** scope (what to build), deliverables
  (files, endpoints, screens), and done-when (acceptance criteria).
- **Keep the status markers accurate.** Agents MUST update them whenever
  reality changes:
  - Flip `[ ]` → `[~]` when work starts on-branch (PR open or commits pushed).
  - Flip `[~]` → `[x]` only when the PR is **merged to `main` AND deployed**
    to the environment the task targets (Railway / Vercel / EAS / n/a).
    Passing locally or on a feature branch is not enough.
  - Flip any marker → `[-]` if the task is dropped; add a one-line reason
    on the same line (e.g. `[-] … — dropped: superseded by 3.2`).
- **Update as part of the merge itself**, not in a follow-up. The PR that
  lands the work is also the PR that ticks the box.
- **Multiple checkboxes per task** (scope / deliverables / done-when): tick
  each one independently as it becomes true. Partial progress is fine — the
  state should match reality.
- **Split tasks if they balloon.** If a task takes more than a day, break it
  and add sub-tasks under the parent.

Legend: `[ ]` open · `[~]` in progress (branch/PR exists) · `[x]` done
(merged + deployed) · `[-]` dropped

## Phase 0 — Foundations (app runs, tested, deployable)

**Goal:** a clean pnpm monorepo with `apps/api`, `apps/mobile`, `apps/admin`
wired end-to-end. CI runs lint + typecheck + tests. API + Postgres deployed

  ticket issued.

## Cross-cutting — run alongside phases

- [ ] **X.1** i18n scaffolding (mobile + admin), PT-BR default, copy in
      `packages/i18n/`.
- [ ] **X.2** LGPD: `POST /me/delete` (soft delete + 30-day purge job),
      `POST /me/export` (async, emails a download link).
- [ ] **X.3** App Store + Play Store listings (screenshots, privacy
      questionnaire, content rating).
- [ ] **X.4** Legal: Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, LGPD notice; linked
      from signup + profile.
- [ ] **X.5** E2E happy-path tests on mobile with Maestro: signup → buy
      ticket → show QR.
- [x] **X.6** Accessibility pass on mobile (dynamic type, contrast,
      VoiceOver/TalkBack labels).
- [~] **X.7** Observability dashboards (Sentry releases, Railway metrics,
  Stripe radar alerts). Code + docs landed via JDMA-45; Sentry alert
  rules + synthetic-fire test pending CEO confirmation in the Sentry
  UI before the box can flip to `[x]`.
- [x] **X.8** Backups + restore rehearsal for Postgres (Railway provides;
      verify a restore).

## Deferred items (carry-over from earlier phases)

Items that were in scope for a prior phase but were intentionally pushed out
because they were not on the critical path for the current feature chunk.
Each one still counts against the `[x]` gate — later phases can ship work
that depends on these, but the earlier task's checkbox cannot flip to `[x]`
until the deferred piece lands.

**Agents:** when you pick up work that lifts one of these, also flip the
originating checkbox above (one PR, one box, in the same merge).

### From Phase 0

- **0.9 EAS configuration** — deferred until the first real mobile build is
  needed (Chunk D / roadmap 1.10 onward).
- **0.12 Railway deploy (API + Postgres)** — ✅ landed. Railway prod live
  at `jdm-production.up.railway.app` as of 2026-05-02. F1.1–F1.6 flipped
  to `[x]`.
- **0.13 Vercel deploy (Admin)** — deferred until F7a admin work starts
  (roadmap 7.1+). Not on the critical path for F1–F6.
- **0.14 Secrets & env management** — partially done (`docs/secrets.md`
  covers auth secrets from chunk A). Full inventory still owed for Stripe,
  AbacatePay, R2, Sentry, Expo.
- **0.15 Sentry projects** — deferred. `sentryPlugin` hook exists in the
  API but no DSN wired; admin + mobile not wired at all.
- **0.16 README + CONTRIBUTING** — deferred until a new engineer actually
  needs to onboard.

### From Phase 1 — F1 Auth

- **1.7 Google sign-in (API)** — deferred to post-MVP. Email+password is
  sufficient for v0.1 release. Plan: `phase-1-f1-auth-plan.md` Task 16
  stays in the plan for later pickup; AuthProvider table already exists
  in the schema so the future implementation can start without a migration.
- **1.8 Apple sign-in (API)** — deferred to post-MVP. Same reasoning as 1.7.
  Plan: Task 17.
- **1.11 Mobile Google sign-in** — deferred, blocked on 1.7. Plan: Task 26.
- **1.12 Mobile Apple sign-in** — deferred, blocked on 1.8. Plan: Task 27.

No other phase has deferrals yet. When a later phase carries work forward,
add a `### From Phase N` subsection here with the same format.
